# Disting File Assistant

The Disting File Assistant is a Python script for generating additional files (playlists) for the Expert Sleepers MK3 / MK4 modules.
Currently it can generate audio, MIDI and wavetable playlists.


## Requirements
	- Python 3
	- [EasyGUI library](http://easygui.sourceforge.net)
	
## How to Use

Download or clone the repo, open the terminal and enter the following command to run the Python script:

``` python3 /path/to/folder/disting.py ```

The script will then ask you to select an operation and will prompt you to select the path to your MicroSD card.
